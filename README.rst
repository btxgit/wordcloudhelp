Wordcloud processing.  Makes a very nice image out of the wordlist you
provide.  This comes with a couple images for test purposes.

Only tested with Python3.7

Required libs with the versions I tested:

wordcloud == 1.6.0
Pillow == 5.4.1
numpy == 1.16.1

To use:

clone repo, cd into the clone dir and run wordcloudhelp.py without any
arguments.  It shoudl produce an output file - it might take a couple
minutes since the number of words is rather long.
